Add the methods successor and predecessor to the LinkedBST class.
Each method expects an item as an argument and returns an item or
None. A successor is the smallest item in the tree that is greater
than the given item. A predecessor is the largest item in the tree
that is less than the given item. Note that the successor may exist
even if the given item is not present in the tree.
